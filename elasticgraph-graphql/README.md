## Usage

Most of the time, an `elasticgraph-graphql` endpoint is served via HTTP using `elasticgraph-rack` or `elasticgraph-graphql_lambda`.
However, you can interact with it directly in Ruby:

```ruby
require "elastic_graph/graphql"

graphql = ElasticGraph::GraphQL.from_yaml_file("config/settings/local.yaml")
graphql.graphql_query_executor.execute("query { __typename }") # Returns a GraphQL response.
```
