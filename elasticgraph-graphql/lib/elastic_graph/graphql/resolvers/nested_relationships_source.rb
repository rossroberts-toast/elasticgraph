    module Resolvers
      # A GraphQL dataloader responsible for solving a thorny N+1 query problem related to our `NestedRelationships` resolver.
      # The `QuerySource` dataloader implements a basic batching optimization: multiple datastore queries are batched up into
      # a single `msearch` call against the dataastore. This is significantly better than submitting a separate request per
      # query, but is still not optimal--the datastore still must execute N different queries, which could cause significant load.
      #
      # A significantly improved optimization is possible in one particular situation from our `NestedRelationships` resolver.
      # Here's an example of that situation:
      #
      #   - `Part` documents are indexed in a `parts` index and `Manufacturer` documents are indexed in a `manufacturers` index.
      #   - `Part.manufacturer` is defined as: `t.relates_to_one "manufacturer", "Manufacturer", via: "manufacturer_id", dir: :out`.
      #   - We are processing a GraphQL query like this: `parts(first: 10) { nodes { manufacturer { name } } }`.
      #   - For each of the 10 parts, the `NestedRelationships` resolver has to resolve its related `Part.manufacturer`.
      #   - Without the optimization provided by this class, `NestedRelationships` would have to execute 10 different queries,
      #     each of which is identical except for a different filter: `{id: {equal_to_any_of: [part.manufacturer_id]}}`.
      #   - Instead of executing this as 10 different queries, we can instead execute it as one query with this combined filter:
      #     `{id: {equal_to_any_of: [part1.manufacturer_id, ..., part10.manufacturer_id]}}`
      #   - When we do this, we get a single response, but `NestedRelationships` expects a separate response for each one.
      #   - To satisfy that, we can split the single response into 10 different responses (one per filter).
      #
      # This optimization, when we can apply it, results in much less load on the datastore. In addition, it also helps to reduce
      # the amount of overhead imposed by ElasticGraph. Profiling has shown that significant overhead is incurred when we repeatedly
      # merge filters into a query (e.g. `query.merge_with(internal_filters: [{id: {equal_to_any_of: [part.manufacturer_id]}}])` 10 times to
      # produce 10 different queries). This optimization also avoids that overhead.
      #
      # Note: while the comments discuss the examples in terms of _parent objects_, in the implementation, we deal with id sets.
      # A set of ids is contributed by each parent object.
      class NestedRelationshipsSource < ::GraphQL::Dataloader::Source
        # The optimization implemented by this class is not guaranteed to get all expected results in a single query for cases where
        # the sorted search results are not well-distributed among each of the parent objects while we're resolving a `relates_to_many`
        # field. (See the comments on `fetch_via_single_query_with_merged_filters` for a detailed description of when this occurs).
        #
        # To deal with this situation, we retry the query for just the parent objects which may have incomplete results. However,
        # each attempt is run in serial, and we want to put a strict upper bound on how many attempts are made. This constant defines
        # the maximum number of optimized attempts we allow.
        #
        # When exceeded, we fall back to building and executing a separate query (via a single `msearch` request) for each parent object.

        #
        # 4 was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but should make reattempts needed much less often while avoiding asking for an unreasonably
        # large number of results.
        #
        # Note: asking the datastore for a larger `size` is quite a bit more efficient than needing to execute more queries.
        # Once the datastore has gone to the spot in its inverted index with the matching documents, asking for more results
        # isn't particularly expensive, compared to needing to re-run an extra query.

        # For "simple", document-based queries, we can safely merge filters. However, this cannot be done safely when the response

        #     for each parent object unless we execute separate queries (or combine them into a grouped aggregation count query,
        #     but that requires a much more challenging transformation of the query and response).

        # Executes a single query that contains a merged filter from the set union of the given `id_sets`.
        # This merged query is (theoretically) capable of getting all the results we're looking for in a
        # single query, which is much more efficient than building and performing a separate query for each
        # id set. We can use `search_response.filter_results(id_set)` with each id set to get a
        # response with the documents filtered down to just the ones that match the id set. (Essentially,
        # this is the response we would have gotten if we had executed a separate query for the id set).
        #
        # However, it is not guaranteed that we will get back complete results with this approach. Consider this example:
        #
        #   - The datastore has 50 documents that match `id_set_1`, and 50 that match `id_set_2`.
        #   - The requested size of `@query` is 10 (meaning the client expects the first 10 results matching `id_set_1` and
        #     the first 10 results matching `id_set_2).
        #   - All 50 documents that match `id_set_1` sort before all 50 documents that match `id_set_2`.
        #   - When we execute our merged query filtering on the `union(id_set_1, id_set_2)` set, we ask for
        #     20 documents (since we want 10 for `id_set_1` and 10 for `id_set_2`).
        #   - ...but we get back 20 documents for `id_set_1` and 0 documents for `id_set_2`.
        #
        # There is no way to guarantee that we get back the desired number of results for each id set unless we build and
        # execute a separate query per id set, which is inefficient (in some situations, it causes one GraphQL query to
        # execute hundreds of queries against the datastore!).
        #
        # To deal with this possibility, this method takes an iterative approach:
        #
        #   - It builds and executes an initial optimized merged query, with a large `size_multiplier` which gives us a good bit of
        #     "headroom" for this kind of situation. In the example above, if we requested 60 results from the datastore, we'd be
        #     able to get the 10 results for both id sets we are looking for--50 for `id_set_1` nad 10 for `id_set_2`.
        #   - It then inspects the response. If the datastore returned fewer results than we asked for, then there are no missing
        #     results and we can trust that we got all the results we would have gotten if we had executed a separate query per
        #     id set.
        #   - If we got back the number of results we asked for, then it's possible that we've run into this situation. We need
        #     to inspect each filtered response produced for each id set to see if more results were expected.
        #     - Note: the fact that more results were expected doesn't necessarily mean there are more results. But we have no way
        #       to tell for sure without querying the datastore again, so we err on the side of safety and treat this kind of response
        #       as being incomplete.
        #   - For each id set that appears to be incomplete, we try again. But on the next attempt, we exclude the id sets
        #     which got a complete set of results.
        #   - This may cause us to iterate a couple of times (which could make the single GraphQL query we are processing slower than
        #     it would have been without this optimization, particularly if the datastore was not under any other load...) but we expect
        #     it to make a big difference in the amount of load we put on the datastore, and that helps _all_ query traffic to be more
        #     performant overall.
