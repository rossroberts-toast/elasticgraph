      # For each operation, 1 of 4 things will happen, each of which will be treated differently:
      #
      #   1. The operation was successfully applied to the datastore and updated its state.
      #      The operation will be included in the successful operation of the returned result.
      #   2. The operation could not even be attempted. For example, an `Update` operation
      #      cannot be attempted when the source event has `nil` for the field used as the source of
      #      the destination type's id. The returned result will not include this operation.
      #   3. The operation was a no-op due to the external version not increasing. This happens when we
      #      process a duplicate or out-of-order event. The operation will be included in the returned
      #      result's list of noop results.
      #   4. The operation failed outright for some other reason. The operation will be included in the
      #      returned result's failure results.
