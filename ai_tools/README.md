# AI Tools

To help you build an ElasticGraph project, you can use these tools with AI agents.

## Components

### ElasticGraph MCP Servier

Located in [`elasticgraph-mcp-server/`](./elasticgraph-mcp-server/), this provides a server implementation for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). MCP enables AI agents to:

- Dynamically discover and use tools through function calling
- Access contextual information through a standardized protocol
- Interact with extensions that provide specific functionality

You can use the MCP server with a variety of tools and platforms, including:

- in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) as an "MCP tool"
- in [Goose](https://goose-docs.ai/) as an "extension"
- in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) as an "MCP server"
- in [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) as an "MCP server"
